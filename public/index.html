                            <p>For more than half a decade, we’ve been performing together as a group of friends, bringing music and light to dozens of simchas and events, and raising tens of thousands for our wonderful charities.</p>
                            <p>Having initially performed as The 4 Sons, we relaunched as Kol Tov when we started university in 2018. This name represents what we’re all about – not just high quality music, but also using our ‘Kolot’ (voices) in another way to share our central message wherever we go – that you can take something you love and use it to make the world a better place.</p>

From our atmospheric Shabbat melodies to our awesome a cappella arrangements, we bring our mission of ‘making a difference through music’ not only to the beneficiaries of our charities, but also to every guest who hears us perform.</p>
