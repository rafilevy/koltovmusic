                <p>
                    Since we started back in 2012, we have been
                    performing together for more than half a decade as <b>The 4 Sons</b>, bringing music and light to
                    dozens of simchas and <b>raising more than £50,000</b> for our wonderful charities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve been working hard as a group to improve at every stage and we’re really excited to be
                    back performing for you once more, with brand new music and a brand new name: <b>Kol Tov!</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For us, this name represents what we’re all about – it’s not just about the quality of our
                    music, but it’s also about using our ‘Kolot’ (voices) in another way to share our central message
                    wherever we go – <b>that you can take something you love and use it to make the world a better place.</b>

Singing a cappella is so rewarding – when all the harmonies come together it brings a smile to my face. But for me, the most rewarding thing is that the group is using a combined passion for singing to make a real difference to the lives of many. I want to spread the message that anyone can take something they love and use it to make the world a better place. I am seriously proud of the amount of money we have raised for charity since 2012 – the efforts of every member of ‘The Family’ is astonishing. Long may it continue!"</p>
